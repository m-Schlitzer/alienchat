# alienchat

You need to have your environment vars set like this:
```
export PGPASSWORD="password"
export PGUSER="user"
export PGDATABASE="chat"
export PGPORT="27015"
export PGHOST="localhost"
```
This is only a prototype based on the websocket-chat example from actix-web for now. Additional information will be available as soon as we are ready.
